### Hi there! 👋 I’m Vick

🚀 I’m a Senior Software Engineer with 11+ years of experience building and running production-grade products. I’ve worked across backend, frontend, and cloud infrastructure, with a strong focus on clean architecture, reliability, and long-term maintainability.

👨‍💻 I like owning features end to end - from system design and APIs to frontend delivery, databases, and infrastructure. I care about writing clear, testable code and building systems that other engineers can confidently extend.

🤖 In recent years, I’ve focused on AI-powered products, integrating LLMs into real-world systems. I treat AI as a core system component, with proper design, monitoring, and cost control - not as an experiment.


### What I'm currently focusing 📚
- Building scalable, production-ready systems
- Designing APIs and frontend architecture for long-term growth
- Developing AI-assisted features that automate real workflows
- Improving reliability, observability, and performance in production

🧰 Software Engineering Expertise 
- Full-stack system design with clean, maintainable architecture
- API development (REST, async workflows, real-time, background jobs)
- Frontend architecture, state management, and performance
- Distributed systems, messaging, and event-driven design
- Cloud infrastructure, CI/CD, and production monitoring
- Writing tests and maintaining high code quality over time

🤖 AI & LLM Expertise
- Hands-on experience with LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini)
- Prompt architecture with reusable templates, contracts, and versioning
- Agentic systems with tool calling, memory, and multi-step workflows
- RAG pipelines using embeddings, hybrid search, and reranking
- Vector databases: Milvus, Pinecone, FAISS, pgvector
- LLM evaluation, quality tracking, hallucination reduction
