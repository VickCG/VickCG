### Hi there! 👋 I’m Vick

🚀 I’m a Senior Software Engineer with 10+ years of experience building, scaling, and maintaining production-grade systems across web, backend, and cloud infrastructure. Over the years, I’ve worked on everything from core business platforms to high-traffic SaaS products, always with a strong focus on reliability, performance, and clean architecture.

👨‍💻 I enjoy owning systems end to end, from system design and API architecture, to database modeling, infrastructure, and long-term maintainability. I care deeply about writing clear, testable code and building systems that other engineers can confidently extend.|

🤖 In recent years, I’ve specialized in AI-powered software, integrating LLMs into real products — not as experiments, but as first-class system components. My approach to AI is strongly engineering-driven: designing workflows, safeguards, and infrastructure so AI features remain stable, observable, and cost-effective in production.


### What I'm currently focusing 📚
- Building and scaling production-ready backend systems
- Designing APIs and system architectures for long-term growth
- Developing AI-assisted features that automate real business workflows
- Improving reliability, performance, and observability of AI systems

🧰 Software Engineering Expertise 
- Backend system design, clean architecture, and domain-driven thinking
- API development (REST, async workflows, background jobs)
- Data modeling and performance optimization
- Distributed systems, messaging, and event-driven architecture
- Cloud infrastructure, CI/CD, and production monitoring
- Writing tests and building systems that are easy to maintain over time

🤖 AI & LLM Expertise
- Hands-on experience with LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini)
- Prompt architecture with reusable templates, contracts, and versioning
- Agentic systems with tool calling, memory, and multi-step workflows
- RAG pipelines using embeddings, hybrid search, and reranking
- Vector databases: Milvus, Pinecone, FAISS, pgvector
- LLM evaluation, quality tracking, hallucination reduction
